The Python repository "SAI" contains the scripts, data, figures, and text for investigating the effect of stratospheric aerosol injection on large-scale climate signals between WACCM and ARISE large ensembles. In particular, we focus on regional precipitation and temperature patterns and use explainable AI methods to better understand their nonlinear relationships to external climate forcing.
